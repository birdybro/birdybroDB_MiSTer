# birdybroDB_MiSTer
Just my personal db of MiSTer FPGA configs and stuff so I can sync between my three MiSTer's and reinstall easier.

This was made using [@theypsilon](https://github.com/theypsilon)'s [DB-Template_MiSTer](https://github.com/theypsilon/DB-Template_MiSTer).

## Instructions

Add the following to the bottom of your `downloader.ini` file:

```ini
[birdybro/birdybroDB_MiSTer]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdybro/birdybroDB_MiSTer/db/db.json.zip
```
